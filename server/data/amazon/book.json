Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World                                      Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.          In Deep Work, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four “rules,” for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.          A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, Deep Work takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories—from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air—and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.\nRead more","pricing":"","list_price":"","shipping_price":"FREE","availability_status":"In Stock","images":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/418ENpC+3ML._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"],"product_category":"Books › Business & Economics › Management & Leadership","average_rating":4.7,"small_description":"","feature_bullets":[],"total_answered_questions":0,"customization_options":{},"seller_id":null,"seller_name":"Amazon.eg","fulfilled_by_amazon":true,"fast_track_message":"","aplus_present":true},{"type":"search_product","position":17,"name":"Dork Diaries By Rachel Renee Russell 12 Books Collection Set (Puppy Love, Holiday Heartbreak, TV Star, Pop Star, OMG, Skating Sensation, Party Time) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2017] Rachel Renee Russell","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91vY6qLUXqL.jpg","has_prime":false,"is_best_seller":false,"is_amazon_choice":false,"is_limited_deal":false,"stars":4.8,"total_reviews":1486,"url":"https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Diaries-Collection-Heartbreak-Sensation-Paperback/dp/1471168646/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=book&qid=1677367973&sr=8-17","availability_quantity":4,"spec":{},"price_string":"EGP 750.00","price_symbol":"EGP","price":750,"product_information":{"ASIN":"‎1471168646","Language":"‎English","Paperback":"‎100 pages","ISBN-10":"‎9781471168642","ISBN-13":"‎978-1471168642","Dimensions":"‎13.6 x 6.1 x 20.8 cm","Best Sellers Rank":["#350 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)","#6 in Diaries","#1,380 in Home Décor Products"],"Customer reviews":{"ratings_count":1,"stars":4.8}},"brand":"","brand_url":null,"full_description":"From the Publisher\nDork Diaries: 12 Books Collection Set by Rachel Renee Russell                                     Dork Diaries: Frenemies Forever       Nikki is spending a week at North Hampton Hills as part of the school transfer programme.

April 2017 marks 20 years since Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal Finance arena.       It has been translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world.       Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.       In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this classic, Robert offers an update on what we’ve seen over the past 20 years related to money, investing, and the global economy. Sidebars throughout the book will take readers “fast forward” — from 1997 to today — as Robert assesses how the principles taught by his rich dad have stood the test of time.\nRead more\nIn many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two decades ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years ago.       As always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful... and continue to rock more than a few boats in his retrospective.       Will there be a few surprises? Count on it.       Rich Dad Poor Dad...

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman’s seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life’s work. It will change the way you think about thinking.       Two systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent.       Kahneman’s singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives–and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.","pricing":"","list_price":"","shipping_price":"EGP21","availability_status":"In Stock","images":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41r2OmyhA+L._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"],"product_category":"Books › Health, Fitness & Nutrition › Psychology & Counseling","average_rating":4.7,"small_description":"","feature_bullets":[],"total_answered_questions":0,"customization_options":{},"seller_id":"A2CYYJJF5XVPZ","seller_name":"Dopamine.Store","fulfilled_by_amazon":null,"fast_track_message":"","aplus_present":true},{"type":"search_product","position":37,"name":"Turtles All The Way Down","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eoaXjRqJL.jpg","has_prime":true,"is_best_seller":true,"is_amazon_choice":false,"is_limited_deal":true,"stars":4.6,"total_reviews":4750,"url":"https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Turtles-All-Down-John-Green/dp/0241335434/ref=sr_1_37?keywords=book&qid=1677367973&sr=8-37","availability_quantity":null,"spec":{},"price_string":"EGP 580.00","price_symbol":"EGP","price":580,"product_information":{"Publisher":"‎John Green (10 October 2017)","Language":"‎English","Paperback":"‎304 pages","ISBN-10":"‎0241335434","ISBN-13":"‎978-0241335437","Reading age":"‎13 - 17 years","Dimensions":"‎15.5 x 2.8 x 22.4 cm","Best Sellers Rank":["#67 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)","#1 in Romance for Young Adults","#1 in Fiction About Social & Family Issues for Young Adults","#1 in Books on Social & Family Issues for Young Adults"],"Customer reviews":{"ratings_count":4,"stars":4.6}},"brand":"by John Green  (Author)","brand_url":null,"full_description":"","pricing":"","list_price":"","shipping_price":"FREE","availability_status":"In Stock","images":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Al36VjUYL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_ML2_.jpg"],"product_category":"Books › Teen & Young Adult › Literature & Fiction","average_rating":4.6,"small_description":"","feature_bullets":[],"total_answered_questions":0,"customization_options":{},"seller_id":null,"seller_name":"Amazon.eg","fulfilled_by_amazon":true,"fast_track_message":"","aplus_present":false},{"type":"search_product","position":38,"name":"Eat Yourself Healthy by Dr. Megan Rossi: An easy-to-digest guide to health and happiness from the inside out.
